# License

It's a complicated situation as a recreation of a former app. Basically, try not to use parts of this Flappy Bird's code in other serious projects which
aren't for personal use only, as the code might and probably is an infringement of the original Flappy Bird copyright.

This recreation of Flappy Bird is **not** open-source by official definition, but rather source-available - you can view it, and maybe even
make/submit changes/updates to it, but you don't own the code. Neither do we, in my opinion.

Still, feel free to fork this and improve it for personal purposes or just making this Java 64-bit version of Flappy Bird better in general.
